# Fishino "xml"

This project is derived from Arduino_domotic_house main project, with the difference of using an Fishino Mega instead of Arduino Mega.

With Fishino (and Fishino Mega, of course), we can define a standalone wi-fi network and use it instead uf using an ethernet cable (and relative ethernet shield used with Arduino Mega).
I called the standalone wi-fi network "MyFishino" (without password): this can be changed at lines 103-104 of the sketch.
