# Arduino with images

This is an updated version of the one in the main directory.
In the micro-sd card we have to copy some files:
- index.html
- style.css
- ajax.js
- lamp.png
- sensor.png

ArduinoHomeAuto.ino is the scketch to upload to Arduino Mega.

When the browser runs index.html, two small images appears (it's a bit slow, but that's it).
