# arduino_domotic_house

This is a prototype project made by my son and I for his graduation exam at the end of his school route.

This project involves the use of:
- a small house (you can see it on the pictures)
- an Arduino Mega ('cause of too many connections)
- an ethernet shield
- sensors and actuators of different kind
- several leds
- a fan
- an lcd display
- some meters of multi-colored connecting cable

In the master branch you can see this files:
- ArduinoHomeAuto.ino : the source Arduino code
- index.html : the simple web page run on the pc connected via an ethet cable

Aftwerards I created new branches:
arduino_with_images : I've addes the management of two small images on the web page
fishino_xml  :  same project with the use of Fishino Mega instead of Arduino Mega (in this way we can use wi-fi)
fishino_json :  same project buf the ajax protocol is done with json instead of xml file
